Dear [customer name]

Thank you for your partnership with The Knot!  We have been notified that your ACH payment for your account ending [XXXX] has been denied by your bank.  This has left an outstanding balance on your account in the amount of [$0.00].  

We have processed your payment again on your ACH account ending [XXXX] in the amount of [$0.00].

If this payment is also denied by your bank your account will be cancelled for non-payment and the outstanding balance may be sent to an outside agency for additional collection efforts, unless you contact us immediately with an alternative form of payment.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter!
