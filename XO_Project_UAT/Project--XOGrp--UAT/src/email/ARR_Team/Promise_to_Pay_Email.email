Dear [customer name]

Thank you for speaking with me today!  Per our conversation, we have agreed to a promised payment to get your past due balance brought current and keep your services live on The Knot!

You have agreed to have your payment in the amount of [$0.00] to The Knot no later than [DATE].

If your payment does not reach us by the agreed upon date and you have not notified us within 24 hours of the payment due date, you will be in default of this arrangement.  Your services will be cancelled for non-payment and the outstanding balance may be sent to an outside agency for additional collection efforts.
