Dear [customer name]:

Thank you for your partnership with The Knot!  I tried to reach you by phone but was unsuccessful.  This email is to inform you that you are currently in default of our payment agreement entered into on [DATE].  

Per the agreement email that was sent to you on [DATE], you will have 5 days to pay the outstanding balance of [$0.00] in full.  If payment in full is not received by [DATE] your services with The Knot will be cancelled and your outstanding balance may be sent to an outside agency for additional collection efforts.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter!
