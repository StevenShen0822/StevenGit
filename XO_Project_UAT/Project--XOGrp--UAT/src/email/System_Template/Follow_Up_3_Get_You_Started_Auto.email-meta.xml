    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Your Account Strategist team here again - reaching out to help make the most of your partnership with The Knot, starting with your Storefront!

I tried giving you a buzz today, but unfortunately we weren’t able to connect. We’d like to help optimize your Storefront to connect you with the couples that are best for your business.

To easily schedule the best time to chat, I’ve included a link to schedule. Please pick the date/time that works best for you, or give us a call.

Hope to talk to you soon!</textOnly>
