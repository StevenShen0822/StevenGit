    <textOnly>Welcome to The Knot Pro community! My name is {!Case.Strategy_Specialist__c}, your Senior Account Strategist and I will be your go-to support for everything from optimizing your Storefront to connecting with the couples that are best for your business.


First thing’s first. Let’s get you set up:



Schedule an Onboarding Call:

Jump on a quick call with us - we’ll get your Storefront off the ground and go over a few best practices. It’ll only take about 30 minutes. Promise.

Click Here to Schedule!




Log in to your account:

Keep an eye out for an email containing your login info to The Knot Pro. Already have access? Awesome. You should be all set.

PRO TIP: Prior to our onboarding call you’ll want to log in, poke around and start completing your Storefront. Oh, and jot down any questions you might have for me!


Call or email with any questions, any time and we will be more than happy to help!
