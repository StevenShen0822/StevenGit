    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact},


I am {!Case.Strategy_Specialist__c}, your Senior Account Strategist here at The Knot, reaching out! I am your go-to to help ensure your Storefront makes the best first impression with couples.


I tried giving you a buzz today, but unfortunately, we weren’t able to connect. I’d like to set up a quick call to help get your Storefront up and running and go through the tools and resources you can use to manage your leads.

To easily schedule a call at your convenience, I’ve included a link to schedule. Please pick the date/time that works best for you, or give us a call.

Talk soon!
