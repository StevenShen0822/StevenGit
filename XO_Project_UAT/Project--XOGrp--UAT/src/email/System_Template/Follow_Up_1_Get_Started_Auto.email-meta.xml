    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Your Account Strategist team here at The Knot, reaching out! We’re your go-to support team, to help ensure your Storefront makes the best first impression with couples.

I tried giving you a buzz today, but unfortunately we weren’t able to connect. I’d like to set up a quick call to help get your Storefront up and running, and go through the tools and resources you can use to manage your leads.

To easily schedule a call at your convenience, I’ve included a link to schedule. Please pick the date/time that works best for you, or give us a call.

Talk soon!</textOnly>
