    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Your Account Strategist team here at The Knot, following up. I just left a voicemail for you, I know we had planned to go over your new online storefront, but I wasn’t able to reach you.

If there is a time that works better for you, please let me know! To easily schedule the best time to chat, I’ve included a link to schedule. Please pick the date/time that works best for you, or give us a call.

Hope to talk to you soon!</textOnly>
